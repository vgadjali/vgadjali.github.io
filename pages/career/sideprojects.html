                <p class="CYdesc">Carmichael Yoga @Med+Fit is actually the Aerial Yoga studio I go to when I am in Sacramento, CA. I originally came across this studio when I was looking for aerial studios online, but was quite frustrated with their website as there were many dead end links that lead to pages with no information. After spending a few months taking their classes and getting to know the owner and instructors, I offered my services to work on their website for them. They were estatic and told me I was a godsend.</p>
                <p class="CYdesc">I quickly came up with a rough outline of how I envisioned their website to look and went over it with the owner of the studio. She gave me her input on some of the pages she liked and certain aspects she specifically wanted. Many times she knew what kind of content she wanted to display, but did not know how to go about it. In those cases, I told her I would handle it and she would let me know if she liked it or wanted me to change it.</p>
                <p class="CYdesc">Carmichael Yoga's website was already set up on Squarespace, so I took the extra time to learn how to use the software to design the website we had planned out. A significant amount of their content was spread out amongst multiple social media platforms, so I had to figure out a way to incorporate them all onto the squarespace platform. Also used by wellness services across 130+ countries, Mindbody was CY's class scheduler and client management. Facebook was their main publicity outlet for special events and Instagram was conveniently used to display their photos. Despite the number of platforms, I still managed to incorporate each of them into the business website.</p>
                <p class="CYdesc">Although they had a lot of resources available for the website, they were still missing a bunch of content. Teacher bios, pictures suitable for the website, and many class descriptions were unavailable when at the start of this project. Since I personally have taken their classes and was very familiar with Aerial Yoga, I helped write up a bunch of their content that I had experience in. This not only helped speed up the process, but also gave them the language and content that was expected of a yoga studio. I had been to many different studios and browsed all of their websites, so I knew what kind of FAQ questions yoga studios usually included or what kind of information people would be looking for if they came to our website.</p>
                <p class="CYdesc">The owner, Cecilia, wanted a design that would be easy to maintain. She was delighted with the final product, which you can see below.</p>
